  <h2>What is the GSA?</h2>
  <p>GSA (Gender and Sexuality Alliance) aims to provide a safe space for LGBTQ+ students and their allies to express themselves, strengthen community, and work to make BHS (Brookline High School) a more inclusive place. We are run by three wonderful facilitators and three excellent faculty advisors.</p>
  <h2>What does the GSA do?</h2>
  <p>The GSA organizes many events, such as advisory activies during Trans Week of Awareness and lectures by guest speakers during Day of Dialouge. We also compile resources and generally have a very fun time.</p>
  <h2>When does the GSA meet?</h2>
  <p>During X Blocks in room 203</p>
