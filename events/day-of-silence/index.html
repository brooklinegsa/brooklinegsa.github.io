  <h1>Day of Silence</h1>
  <p>Day of Silence (DoS) is usually in mid-April and people all over the country stay silent to represent and support oppressed LGBTQ+ people, especially LGBTQ+ youth, who don't typically have the freedom to express themselves. Many students, as well as some teachers, participate.I t is common for teachers to change lessons either to include something about LGBTQ+ people or to allow for quiet independent work, as many students participate in the day. Day of Silence will be held this year on April 22, 2022, over vacation. More information about the day and its history can be found on <a href="www.glsen.org/day-of-silence">GLSEN's website</a>.</p>
