  <h1>Day of Dialogue</h1>
  <p>Day of Dialogue is a full day of learning about LGBTQ+ experiences, including lessons, activites, and assemblies, and is GSA's largest event. Planning for Day of Dialogue typically starts shortly after winter vacation. The <emTelling Our Stories</em> assembly, during which LGBTQ+ students and teachers at the high school share their experiences is often the most impactful part of the day. We also often run lessons in classrooms, and have a middle school involvement program, so those in the middle school GSAs are able to participate. In past years, we've also held panels where LGBTQ+ students and staff will answer questions and talk about their experiences. Additionally, we often host guest speakers. Day of Dialogue will take place April 6th this year.</p>
